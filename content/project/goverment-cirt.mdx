The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CIRT) is a governmental branch in Montenegro dedicated to enhancing cybersecurity in the public sector and promoting cyber awareness. The CIRT blog serves as a platform for sharing important updates, news, and events related to cybersecurity both locally in Montenegro and globally.
As a government entity, CIRT adheres to Montenegro's official web design guidelines, resulting in a clean, well-structured, and user-friendly website. My role in developing this project involved utilizing React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand to create a responsive and visually consistent site, while also optimizing it for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to increase visibility and reach.
