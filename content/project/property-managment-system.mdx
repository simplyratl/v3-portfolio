This freelancing project involved designing the system architecture and managing the deployment to production, with a primary focus on developing two applications: an internal admin panel for managing properties and a public-facing site for users. While my experience is mainly in front-end development, I successfully handled the back-end tasks, including integrating with external services for automatic property listings.
Key challenges included implementing advanced filtering, building complex property forms, and optimizing SEO and page load speeds. Image sliders required lazy loading, which demanded careful attention to performance.
Throughout the project, I collaborated with experienced DevOps professionals to ensure secure hosting practices, gaining valuable experience in full-stack development and system deployment.
